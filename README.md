# Responsible-AI

This repository contains my work done COMP0195 at UCL. 

You should find there:
1. Analyse of the performance of multiple ML models i.e., interpretable-by-design approach and a black-box technique. 
2. Interpretation of the models.
3. Error Analysis 
4. What - If analysis 
5. Datasheet for the dataset and a model card for the least biased model. 

The whole project was built using the UCI Adult Census Income dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
